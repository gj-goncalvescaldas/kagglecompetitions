## üìç Problem Description

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data 

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores across 7 European countries. In this project, I take on the challenge of forecasting daily sales for 1,115 stores located in Germany, over a six-week period.

Sales are influenced by a wide range of factors, including:

- Promotions and marketing campaigns  
- Local competition  
- School and public holidays  
- Seasonality and events  
- Store-specific and geographic characteristics

## üéØ Project Objective

As a solo data practitioner, my goal is to build a scalable and reliable forecasting model using **Apache Spark** within the **Databricks Community Edition** environment.

This notebook will serve as a complete, end-to-end pipeline ‚Äî from data cleaning and exploration, through feature engineering and modeling, to performance evaluation ‚Äî all executed with **PySpark**.

## üí° Why This Matters

Accurate forecasts help Rossmann store managers to:

- Plan staff schedules more effectively  
- Boost operational productivity  
- Improve team morale  
- Deliver better customer service  

By building this predictive solution, I aim to support data-driven decision-making and demonstrate the practical use of big data tools in real-world retail operations.

This is a personal project designed to enhance my skills in **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **big data analytics** using **Spark**.
